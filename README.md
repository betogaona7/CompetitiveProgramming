# Competitive programming
This repository contains my solutions for competitive programming problems. Some of them as part of programming contests and others as personal training using the C++ language.

## ACM-ICPC
ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest is an annual multitiered competitive programming competition among universities of world. 

I participated in two editions: 2014 and 2016. The solutions corresponds to the 2016 edition in the first phase of the contest.

## UAdeCoder
UAdeCoder is a local competitive programing competition of the Autonomous University of Coahuila. I participated in one edition and got the third place. 

You can find the problem descriptions by searching in my A2 Online judge site [ profile](https://a2oj.com/profile?Username=alberto) using the problem code (the number of four digits that comes before the name, e.g. `1457 - Oracle of Alexandria`.)
## URI
URI is an online judge that contains more than 1,000 problems divided in 8 big categories. I use this site as a personal training to improve my analytical thinking and my skills as a programmer. 

In my [URI profile](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/es/profile/42933) you can find the problem decriptions or you can search it directly in the [URI site](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/en/login) using the problem code.

## UVa
UVa is another online judge, I solved two problems that you could search in the [UVa site](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/) but for the moment the site is temporarily unavailable. 

## Algorithms 
This folder contains sort algorithms using the pseudocodes written in the book: [Introduction to algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms). 

## HackerRank
Contains the solutions of interview practice questions using C++. The files only contains the solution as a function since HAckerRank gives you the code for reading the input.

## Programming languages
This is a combination of theory and practice in different programming languages. 
	### OOP C++
	Theory of Object Oriented Programming using C++. Practically all the repository is practice of C++.
	### Java
	Started the 30-day challenge of HackerRank as a review of my Java skills. This contains the exercises.
